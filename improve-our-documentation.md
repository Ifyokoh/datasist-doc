First, fork the documentation repository from [here](https://github.com/risenW/datasist-doc)

Next, edit the Markdown cell in the module you want to update. You can copy and use older templates/functions if you are not familiar with Markdown.

After making the changes, save the file, commit, push to your repository on Github and finally,  make a pull request.
